# Server Side Code

--------------------- Tasks Completed and ToDo list as of 02/08/2020 -------------------------

- Server side code can be found in the file server.js

- As of 2/8/2020, I believe the logic for the sign up and login
  is done and should be correct.

- The tasks that are still to be done from this point onwards are:

	1. Getting server.js to receive data from the Login Page and Signup
	   page created by the project frontend engineer (Sohaila)

	2. Send the data to tables in the database
